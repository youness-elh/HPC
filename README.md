## Status


## Problems
* I had to start TP 1 from the start due to my git mistakes!
* In TP2 I had to copy yml file of TP1 to have a working pipline!
* The cmakefile lacks the required .cpp file argument for regextext exec and that was fixed.
* In TP4 the elapsed time, for the alligned vector assumption, is a bit longer than the unalligned case.
