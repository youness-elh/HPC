# At the end of the practical work
* section 5: The case of iterating one cache line after the other is much quicker than accessing all values.
* section 6: The parallel operations are done in the second loop beacause operations (i.e. A[0] and A[1] affectation) are independant.
* section 7: Indeed, when able to use last 3 times history the operation takes less time. The second loop is misleading to the wrong prediction (each 3rd iter).
* section 8: 
* section 9: Using the kway lines storage in the same cache is quicker than working in different caches or even in the same cache but working on single lines which will be evicted once used.
